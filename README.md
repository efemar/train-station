# train-station

This train schedule management app was built to help minimize confusion for train schedules for any city/county.

It requires some input from the user, such as Train Name, Destination, the time of the first train, as well as the frequency at which the train leaves the station.

It calculates when the next train will arrive, as well as the minutes remaining for the next train to arrive.
